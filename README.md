## Learning Goals:

As a student currently enrolled in Turing School of Software Engineering's front-end development program in Module 3, I actively engage in learning activities to enhance my skills. As part of our curriculum, I am working on this project from Turing's Module 3 curriculum: <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-3/react-2-the-how.html">IdeaBox lesson</a> to reinforce my understanding of functional component-based React.

Through this project, my primary objectives are:

- Familiarize myself with the core concepts and principles of React, particularly functional component-based development.
- Demonstrate proficiency in using React's functional components to develop a practical application.
- Strengthen my understanding of React's modular and reusable component structure.
- Apply best practices for organizing and structuring a React project in accordance with industry standards.
- Develop a functional and visually appealing user interface using React's declarative approach and component-based architecture.
- Incorporate Router to organize user navigation to separate pages.
